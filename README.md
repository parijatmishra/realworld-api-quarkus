# ![RealWorld Example App](quarkus-logo.png)

> ### Quarkus Framework codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/) including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the Quarkus community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.

# How it works

This application basicaly uses Quarkus Framework with Java 8 with some other modules known to development community:

* Hibernate 5
* Jackson for JSON
* H2 in memory database
* JPA Criteria
* Auth0 java-jwt

# Getting started

### Start local server

You need a postgresql server that the application can connect to. See `quarkus.datasource.*` properties
[src/main/resources/application.properties](src/test/resources/application.properties)
to find out how the server, db, user must be setup.


```bash
 ./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
 ```
The server should be running at http://localhost:8080


### Running the application tests

You need a postgresql server that the tests can connect to. See `quarkus.datasource.*` properties
[src/test/resources/application.properties](src/test/resources/application.properties)
to find out how the server, db, user must be setup.

``` 
./mvnw test 
```

### Running postman collection tests

Run the server as above ("Start local server"), and the run:

```
./collections/run-api-tests.sh
```

### Building jar file

```
./mvnw package
```

### Building native executable

GraalVM is necessary for building native executable, more information about
setting up GraalVM can be found in [Quarkus guides](https://quarkus.io/guides/)
and database engine need to be changed.

```
./mvnw package -Pnative
```

#### Database changes can be made to the application.properties file.

```properties
# Database configuration
quarkus.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE
quarkus.datasource.driver=org.h2.Driver
quarkus.datasource.username=sa
quarkus.datasource.password=
```
